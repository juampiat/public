## Dockerizados 

Devops_Tools uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


- [Ubuntu Mirroring Server](https://github.com/pro-public/linux-apt-mirror.git)
- [] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [] - evented I/O for the backend
- [] - fast node.js network app framework 
- [] - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [] - duh

And of course devops_tools itself is open source with a [public repository]
 on GitHub.
